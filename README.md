# FreightCommander
The goal of Freight Commander is to simulate the railroad industry as depicted on model railroading layouts by dispatching and tracking freight rolling stock to and from modeled industries. Crew (players) receive dispatch orders as well as check in at various locations in via a smartphone application. Players are faced with a complex puzzle of how to move specific freight cars from the middle of a train into a railroad siding using only push and pull movements in a finite space, in a finite time.

Before going further, please take a moment to look at the Freight Commander Manual in the Docs directory.
